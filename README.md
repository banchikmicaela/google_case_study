## Characters and teams
● Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy
learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic
achieve them.

● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program.

## Ask
Define the key questions or problems that the analysis aims to address. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Business task
Cyclistic's marketing strategy aims to broaden consumer appeal by offering flexible pricing plans, including single-ride and full-day passes, as well as annual memberships. 
The focus is on converting casual riders into profitable annual members, identified as crucial for future growth by Marketing Director Lily Moreno and supported by finance analysts. 
Rather than targeting new customers, the strategy emphasizes leveraging the existing familiarity of casual riders with Cyclistic's program. 


## Prepare
For this project, only the last twelve months (December 2022 to November 2023) will be used. Each file contains ride details logged by Cyclistic customers. 
The data's reliability is affirmed by its large sample size, original source identification, comprehensiveness without critical information gaps, up-to-date relevance, and proper citation. 
These aspects assure the credibility and integrity needed for analysis. [Link to source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
